# TD Everydays
Daily Touchdesigner Experiments
These are messy and hacky daily experiments, shared for the purpose of learning.
Made on a relatively beefy Windows laptop - RTX 2070, they may not run on OSX or lower spec hardware. 
Some are made in experimental builds of TD, and may or may not work in the future.
